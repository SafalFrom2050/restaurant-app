  # Modify /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default with:

  location / {
    index index.php;
    # This is cool because no php is touched for static content
    try_files $uri $uri/ @rewrite;
    expires max;
  }

  location @rewrite {
    # Some modules enforce no slash (/) at the end of the URL
    # Else this rewrite block wouldn&#39;t be needed (GlobalRedirect)
    rewrite ^/(.*)$ /index.php?page=$1;
  }
